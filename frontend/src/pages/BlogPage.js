        <div>
          <p>In my journey as a full-stack developer, React has become my go-to framework for building dynamic user interfaces. The introduction of hooks has revolutionized how we manage state and side effects in functional components.</p>
          <p>Key techniques I've mastered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom hooks for reusable logic</li>
            <li>Context API for global state management</li>
            <li>Performance optimization with React.memo and useMemo</li>
            <li>Server-side rendering with Next.js</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In my recent projects, I've implemented a complex authentication flow using these techniques that reduced code duplication by 40% while improving maintainability.</p>
